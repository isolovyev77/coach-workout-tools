# Cap CLI

Read the CrossFit Affiliate Programming (CAP) daily class plans and weekly overviews. The affiliate toolkit at affiliate.crossfit.com is a React app over a plain JSON content API on c3po.crossfit.com; there is no HTML to scrape. A single content endpoint takes a URN naming the programming document (a daily class plan for a date, or a weekly overview) and returns the workout, its intended stimulus, the load/volume/skill vectors, the class plan timing, scaling, and warm-up material.
Auth is OAuth2 with PKCE: the toolkit is a public client (react_affiliate_toolkit_hBwg8A, scope user:full:read) and holds a short lived Bearer access token. `auth login` also keeps the identity session cookies, and when the saved access token expires the next programming command silently reauthorizes with them - the same way the toolkit site stays signed in, its refresh grant being disabled server-side - and saves the replacement pair. A manually supplied bearer token remains caller-managed and cannot be renewed by the CLI.

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `cap-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-cap` agent skill in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press install cap
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press install cap --cli-only
```


### Without Node

The generated install path is category-agnostic until this CLI is published. If `npx` is not available before publish, install Node or use the category-specific Go fallback from the public-library entry after publish.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/cap-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-cap --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-cap --force
```

## Install for OpenClaw

Tell your OpenClaw agent (copy this):

```
Install the pp-cap skill from https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/tree/main/cli-skills/pp-cap. The skill defines how its required CLI can be installed.
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

See [Install](#install) above.

### 2. Set Up Credentials

Get your access token from your API provider's developer portal, then store it:

```bash
cap-pp-cli auth set-token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

Or set it via environment variable:

```bash
export CROSSFIT_AFFILIATE_PROGRAMMING_BEARER_AUTH="your-token-here"
```

### 3. Verify Setup

```bash
cap-pp-cli doctor
```

This checks your configuration and credentials.

### 4. Try Your First Command

```bash
cap-pp-cli subscriptions --urn example-value
```

## Usage

Run `cap-pp-cli --help` for the full command reference and flag list.

## Commands

### subscriptions

Manage subscriptions

- **`cap-pp-cli subscriptions get-content`** - Returns the content tile for a URN such as content_api:///programming/affiliate/daily-class-plan/YYYYMMDD or content_api:///programming/affiliate/weekly-overview/YYYYMMDD. The response wraps one or more tiles; each tile's acf field holds the programming payload.

### users

Manage users

- **`cap-pp-cli users get-auth-me`** - Returns the authenticated user, used to confirm a token works.


## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
cap-pp-cli subscriptions --urn example-value

# JSON for scripting and agents
cap-pp-cli subscriptions --urn example-value --json

# Filter to specific fields
cap-pp-cli subscriptions --urn example-value --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
cap-pp-cli subscriptions --urn example-value --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
cap-pp-cli subscriptions --urn example-value --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Read-only by default** - this CLI does not create, update, delete, publish, send, or mutate remote resources
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Use with Claude Code

Install the focused skill — it auto-installs the CLI on first invocation:

```bash
npx skills add mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-cap -g
```

Then invoke `/pp-cap <query>` in Claude Code. The skill is the most efficient path — Claude Code drives the CLI directly without an MCP server in the middle.

<details>
<summary>Use as an MCP server in Claude Code (advanced)</summary>

If you'd rather register this CLI as an MCP server in Claude Code, install the MCP binary first:


Install the MCP binary from this CLI's published public-library entry or pre-built release.

Then register it:

```bash
claude mcp add cap cap-pp-mcp -e CROSSFIT_AFFILIATE_PROGRAMMING_BEARER_AUTH=<your-token>
```

</details>

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/cap-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.
3. Fill in `CROSSFIT_AFFILIATE_PROGRAMMING_BEARER_AUTH` when Claude Desktop prompts you.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.


Install the MCP binary from this CLI's published public-library entry or pre-built release.

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cap": {
      "command": "cap-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "CROSSFIT_AFFILIATE_PROGRAMMING_BEARER_AUTH": "<your-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Health Check

```bash
cap-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/crossfit-affiliate-programming-pp-cli/config.toml`

Static request headers can be configured under `headers`; per-command header overrides take precedence.

Environment variables:

| Name | Kind | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CROSSFIT_AFFILIATE_PROGRAMMING_BEARER_AUTH` | per_call | Yes | Set to your API credential. |

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `cap-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $CROSSFIT_AFFILIATE_PROGRAMMING_BEARER_AUTH`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items
